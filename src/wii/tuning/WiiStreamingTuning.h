// Background chunk prefetch shifts generation away from the exact frame where
// the player crosses a chunk boundary. Keep it deliberately slow: one missing
// chunk every two rendered frames -- at WII_TARGET_FPS 30 that is the same
// 15 requests a second the old "every four frames" gave at 60. A request is a
// hash lookup and a queue push; the worker and QUEUE_LIMIT bound the work.

// New terrain discovered outside the occupied chunk is streamed by a low-priority
// LWP worker. Region reads and zlib inflation happen on that worker; the main thread
// only parses the already-inflated NBT and publishes completed chunks per tick.
// Missing-on-disk chunks continue directly into world generation on the same worker.
//
// REQUESTS_PER_TICK moves items from ChunkProvider::wiiGenerationQueue into the
// worker's own queue -- it does not do the I/O/generation work itself, that stays
// on runWiiGenerationThread(). At 1/tick this can starve the worker: the memory
// log put a loaded Wii session at avgFps 5-7 / ~12-14 real ticks/s (see
// [[wii-gxlist-pool]]'s 2026-08-06 entry), so the worker -- lower priority than
// the main thread but otherwise free to run back-to-back -- could finish a chunk
// and then sit in its usleep(1000) idle branch waiting for the next tick to feed
// it one more, instead of draining several queued requests in a row. That idling
// is pop-in: terrain the player is already walking toward is not yet requested.
//
// The REQUESTS budgets bound the wrong thing at 2 and 1. ChunkGenerationScheduler
// ::dispatch() does not generate anything -- it moves a coordinate between two
// deques under a mutex and runs acceptAsyncGenerationCoordinate(), which is a
// chunkMap hash lookup plus a range test. What actually bounds how much terrain
// exists in flight is QUEUE_LIMIT, which requestDetailed() checks against
// pending + worker + results together.
//
// Worse, PER_FRAME scales with the frame rate, so the feed collapsed exactly
// when it was needed: at the avgFps 5-7 the memory log recorded for a loaded
// session (see [[wii-gxlist-pool]]'s 2026-08-06 entry) it delivered 5-7 chunks a
// second instead of 60, while the player kept walking. The worker would finish a
// column and then wait on the next tick for one more, which is pop-in.
//
// Feeding the whole queue costs a handful of hash lookups and lets the worker
// run back-to-back through the CPU the main thread leaves in GX_DrawDone() /
// VIDEO_WaitVSync().
//
// PUBLISH stays where it is, because that one is a real cost: drainAsync-
// GeneratedChunks() is what adds the ~80 KB column to chunkMap and builds its
// skylight, on the main thread. Results already generated but not yet published
// are not counted against the resident cache or eligible for unload eviction,
// and QUEUE_LIMIT is what keeps that backlog bounded -- at 16 columns it is
// ~1.3 MB worst case. Watch the free/ordblks figures on the [WII][RAM] line
// across a walking session before raising the limit itself.
//
// The worker now stops after terrain, caves and ravines (the split PC legacy
// already used; see the scheduler construction in ChunkProvider.cpp), so a
// publish is structures + decoration + Chunk construction + skylight on the
// game thread, ~7-10 ms per column (the worldload trace's structures /
// decorate / newChunk / generateSkylightMap lines). Two per tick on top of one
// per frame could put three of those in one frame. Frames outnumber ticks, so
// the per-frame slot alone is the whole budget: at most one column, ~10 ms,
// per 33 ms frame, which is 30 columns a second against the 3-5 a walking
// player exposes.

// Scheduler priority of that worker. libogc's range is LWP_PRIO_IDLE 0 ..
// LWP_PRIO_HIGHEST 127 and a HIGHER number means MORE priority (ogc/lwp.h), so
// the 96 this used to pass was not low priority at all: it was the highest
// priority in the whole program, above the network threads at 64
// (NetworkManager.cpp), above the audio stream at 80 (SoundManager.cpp), and
// above libogc's own main thread. The comment above already said
// "low-priority"; only the constant disagreed.
//
// That single number is what made the async generator fail to be async. LWP is
// strictly priority-preemptive and does not time-slice, and
// runWiiGenerationThread() blocks nowhere while
// ChunkProviderGenerate::provideChunk() runs -- terrain noise, biome
// replacement, MapGenCaves' 17x17 sweep and generateSkylightMap, all CPU. So
// every generated chunk froze the main thread for its full duration. The stall
// was relocated off the world tick, not removed, and it could now land in the
// middle of a render instead of only inside a tick.
//
// It has to be strictly BELOW the main thread, and "equal" would not do:
// without time-slicing, an equal-priority CPU-bound worker is never preempted
// either. Below it, the worker gets the gap the frame already contains -- the
// main thread sleeps in GX_DrawDone() and VIDEO_WaitVSync() every frame (see
// wiigl_end_frame in gx_wii.cpp), which at 60 fps is several milliseconds of
// genuine leftover CPU.
//
// The trade is pop-in, not a stall: terrain now streams in over several frames
// rather than freezing one. Raise it toward the main thread if chunks cannot
// keep up with a walking player -- never to it or past it.

// Face sorting, now that the Wii does store each direction in a separate GX

//
// wii_native_compile_chunk_list() records the opaque section as one display
// sub-list per direction instead, each at a 32-byte boundary so GX_CallDispList
// can be pointed at it, and the cull below skips the ones facing away. GX would
// reject those triangles at the backface cull regardless; what is saved is
// pushing their vertices through the write-gather pipe and the transform unit
// first. The split costs one extra GX_Begin plus alignment padding per
// direction, which is why faceCull= in the [WII][RAM] line reports how many
// sub-lists were actually skipped -- if that number is small, this is overhead.
